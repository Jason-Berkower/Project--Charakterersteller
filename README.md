# Project Overview

## Project Name

Charakterersteller

## Project Description

This project intends to serve as a foray into the realm of random character generators for the popular tabletop roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons. Interaction with this app will see users stepping away with the information they'd need to inhabit and develop a fledgling adventurer.

## API and Data Sample

```
{
	"index": "rogue",
	"name": "Rogue",
	"hit_die": 8,
	"proficiency_choices": [
		{
			"choose": 4,
			"type": "proficiencies",
			"from": [
				{
					"index": "skill-acrobatics",
					"name": "Skill: Acrobatics",
					"url": "/api/proficiencies/skill-acrobatics"
				}
```

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

#### MVP 

1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Styled using Flexbox or Grid.
3. Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
4. Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint (i.e. desktop, tablet, mobile, etc).
5. Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
6. Deployed site to a hosting service like Github Pages.
7. Make commits to GitHub every day.
8. A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i.

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API (possibly a third).
- Try out designing a personal API for names.
- Add a random art component to further inspiration.
- Allow the user to download a .txt file including their randomly generated character.
